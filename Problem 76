Similar question to coin counting game, except 100 can't be expressed as 100 + 0

However, in the question it's implicitly assumed that number can be expressed as itself (except when considering that number). i.e. when considering 4, can't do 4 = 4 + 0. But 5 = 4 + 1 (meaning 4 can be expressed as 4 + 0)

so as in coin counting, but this time the coins are : [1..99]

Thus

nu = 100
ways = [0] *(1+nu)
ways[0] = 1
#ways[1] = 1
coins=list(range(1,nu))
for i in range(0,len(coins)):
    for j in range(coins[i], nu+1):
        ways[j] += ways[j-coins[i]]
print(ways[100])
